Visual question answering (VQA) with knowledge is a task that requires knowledge to answer questions on images/video. This additional requirement of knowledge poses an interesting challenge on top of the classic VQA tasks. Specifically, a system needs to explore external knowledge sources to answer the questions correctly, as well as understanding the visual content.

We created a dedicated dataset for our knowledge VQA task and made it open to public, so that everyone can enjoy our new task. We have also publish several papers on this task.
